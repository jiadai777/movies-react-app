## Movies List React App

This React app displays a list of movies from the json data source. To save space on Github, the node_modules folder is not uploaded. Please create an initial react app and replace the files with files in this repository.
The app is also deployed at https://cranky-kalam-8fa8a7.netlify.com/

##Usage
The top of the app displays the trailer and basic info about the first movie in the list. Below it are lists of other movies. When you click on a movie, it will change the top info section with the clicked movie's info. Also, as you scroll down the page, the trailer of the movie will show up at the lower right corner. You can also slide left and right the movie list as a slideshow.
